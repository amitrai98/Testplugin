        <strong><u>Righop Specialist Terms of Use</u></strong><br>

        <p>Effective:  November 18, 2014</p>
            
        <p>PLEASE READ THIS TERMS OF USE AGREEMENT CAREFULLY.  BY REGISTERING AS A SPECIALIST AND USING OUR SERVICE, YOU DEMONSTRATE YOUR AGREEMENT TO BE BOUND BY THESE TERMS, INCLUDING ANY AND ALL TERMS INCORPORATED BY REFERENCE.  IF YOU DO NOT AGREE TO ALL OF THESE TERMS, YOU MAY NOT ACCESS OR USE OUR SERVICE.</p>
        
        <p>This Terms of Use Agreement (this “Agreement”) is a legal agreement that governs our relationship with users who register to provide information and content through our live interaction platform (the “Service”).  The Service is owned and operated by Lakewood Group, LLC (“we,” “us,” “our,” or “Ringhop”).  This Agreement sets forth and contains all of the terms relating to use of the Service by you, a specialist in your field or entertainer (“you,” “your,” or “Specialist”), and Ringhop.</p>
        
        <p><u>Right to Use</u></p>
        
        <p>Your right to use the Service is subject to any limitations, conditions, and restrictions established and enforced by us from time to time, in our sole discretion.  We may alter, suspend, or discontinue any aspect of the Service at any time, including the availability of any Service feature, database, or content.  We may also impose limits on certain features and aspects of the Service or restrict your access to parts or all of the Service without notice or liability.</p>
        
        <p><u>Our Platform</u></p>
        
        <p>Ringhop provides a platform where a Specialist may present his or her expertise, charge for his or her time, and/or sell advice or services to interested Ringhop users (“Users”).  Ringhop makes no representation or warranty whatsoever as to the willingness or ability of Users to pay for any advice given by the Specialist.  Therefore, Specialist is encouraged to verify the details and credit-worthiness of those Users to whom Specialist gives or contemplates giving advice.</p>
        
        <p><u>Age Requirement</u></p>
        
        <p>You must be 18 years old to register as a Specialist and utilize the Service to interact with Users.  Ringhop shall have the right, but not the obligation, to request that you provide copies of a valid, government-issued, photo ID to establish your compliance with this age requirement.  Failure to provide this information in response to our request will result in immediate termination of your account.
        </p>
        <p><u>Limited License</u></p>
        
        <p>Ringhop grants Specialist a nonexclusive, revocable right to use the Service and the Service’s website provided that Specialist does not copy, modify, create a derivative work of, reverse engineer, disassemble or otherwise attempt to discover any source code, or breach this Agreement.
        </p>
        <p><u>Intellectual Property</u></p>
        
        <p>Ringhop is the sole owner of all the intellectual property, and in particular the copyright, trademarks, database and patents, in the Service and in any software, application, graphics, text and other materials used therein, including the organization of the materials contained therein.</p>
        
        <p>Specialist may not operate robots or spiders to scan Ringhop’s database.  Specialist may use “deep linking” only to his or her personal web page within the Service’s website but not to any other part thereof.  Specialist may not view or present the Service’s website with a graphic user interface different from the one designed by Ringhop.</p>
        
        <p>The Service contains copyrighted material, trade secrets and proprietary information owned by Ringhop.  This Agreement does not grant the Specialist any rights to patents, copyrights, trade secrets, trade names, trademarks (whether registered or unregistered), domain names or any other rights, functions or licenses in respect of the Service. The Specialist may not create derivative software based upon any trade secret, intellectual property or proprietary information of Ringhop.  Furthermore, the Specialist may not sub-license, assign or transfer, sell or make any other commercial use of his or her membership with the Service.</p>
        
        <p>The Specialist may not adapt or use any trademark or trade name, domain name similar to or likely to be confused with that of Ringhop’s (including, without limitation, Ringhop.com), or take any other action that infringes or impairs Ringhop’s trademark rights.</p>
        
        <p>Ringhop shall retain all ownership in and to the Service and all content displayed on the Service’s website, including copies of data transferred or received by Specialist on the site.</p>
        
        <p><u>Code of Conduct</u></p>
        
        <p>You, the Specialist, will be solely and fully liable for all conduct, services, advice, postings and transmissions that are made under your user account.  You represent, warrant and declare that while you are using the Service as a Specialist, you will act according to the following rules:</p>

        <ul class="detail-faq">
            <li>Specialist will be solely responsible for the services provided to Users and to the verification of Users’ identity and other information delivered to you by Users;</li>
            <li>As a platform where Specialist can offer services, Ringhop is not involved in any transactions between Specialist and Users.  Ringhop does not control the accuracy of any information transmitted through the Service by Users or Specialists.  In addition, Ringhop cannot and will not make any effort to verify the identity of any of its Users;</li>
            <li>Specialist agrees that any information or content that Specialist posts or transmits through the Service will not be considered Specialist’s confidential information, but rather this information, whether personal in nature or not, shall be owned by Ringhop.  Specialist further agrees and consents to the Specialist’s chats or transcripts, being captured in any format, controlled, processed and shared by Ringhop with third parties as designated solely by Ringhop;</li>
            <li>Specialist grants Ringhop an unlimited, irrevocable, royalty-free license to use, reproduce, display, edit, copy, transmit, process, control, publicly perform and create derivative works, communicate to the public or any third party any such information and content on a world-wide basis.  Specialist will not attempt to provide any service that he or she is not qualified to provide, even if requested to do so by a User.  Specialist will not answer questions in fields that are not within Specialist’s fields of expertise;</li>
            <li>Specialist will not mislead Users to believe that he or she can provide a service which is outside Specialist’s fields of expertise;</li>
            <li>All interactions between Specialist and User will be billed through the Service regardless if the interaction is online or offline.  Specialist agrees to abide by the pricing terms agreed upon with Users while utilizing the Service;</li>
            <li>All contact between specialists, consumers and any other users who are introduced through the Service must be conducted only through the Service.  Exchange of personal contact information is strictly prohibited.  Any exchange of contact information or communication outside of the Service, whether via personal email, phone, in person or any other means, is strictly prohibited and is a violation of this Agreement.  In the event that Ringhop suspects or determines any such unauthorized contact, Ringhop reserves the right to withhold payments, levy fines, and/or suspend or terminate service in its sole and absolute discretion;</li>
            <li>Specialist will not take any actions that may undermine, disrupt or manipulate the integrity of the user feedback (rating) system on the Service.  Currently only ratings for paid sessions of $[X] and more will count toward the Specialist’s public ratings and rating average.  Ringhop may change the above-mentioned minimum session fee at any time and without warning, and even remove old ratings given for paid sessions with a fee lower than any newly set minimum fee.  Ringhop also reserves the right to exclude without explanation any rating that we think may compromise the integrity of the user feedback system;</li>
            <li>Specialist will not interfere with or disrupt the Service, its website or servers or networks connected to such website;</li>
            <li>Specialist will not attempt to gain unauthorized access to other computer systems or networks connected to the Service, and will not transmit “junk mail,” or any unsolicited mass distribution of email or bulletin board postings;</li>
            <li>Specialist will not transmit through the Service any unlawful, harassing, libelous, privacy invading, abusive, threatening, defamatory, vulgar, obscene, racist, harmful or otherwise objectionable material of any kind;</li>
            <li>Specialist will not disobey or breach this Agreement or any other applicable instructions conveyed by Ringhop or its officers;</li>
            <li>Specialist will not violate any applicable local, state, national or international law, statute, ordinance, rule, regulation or ethical code;</li>
            <li>Specialist will not upload, post, email, transmit or otherwise make available: (a) any information or material that infringes a third-party right, especially copyright or other intellectual property rights; (b) any third-party advertisements, including banner exchange services; (c) software viruses, Trojan horses, worms or any other malicious application; or (d) any information or material which may constitute or encourage conduct that is a criminal offense or civil wrong or otherwise violates any applicable law;</li>
            <li>Specialist will not impersonate any person or entity, or make any false statement regarding Specialist’s employment, agency or affiliation with any person or entity;</li>
            <li>Specialist will not stalk, threaten or harass Users or other Specialists or invade or attempt to invade their privacy;</li>
            <li>Specialist will not violate, or aid or abet the violation of, any applicable local, state, national or international law, statute, ordinance, rule, regulation or ethical code;</li>
            <li>Specialist will not engage in conduct that is harmful, unethical, fraudulent, deceptive or offensive;</li>
            <li>Specialist will not disclose any information that was provided to Specialist by a User and will use his or her best efforts to guard User's privacy; and</li>
            <li>Specialist agrees to comply with all applicable laws regarding use of this Service.  Specialist may not use this Service to solicit the performance of any illegal activity or other activity that infringes the rights of Ringhop or others.  Specialist agrees not to use any device, software or routine to interfere or attempt to interfere with the proper working of the Service or any other person’s use of the Service.  Specialist may not attempt to gain unauthorized access to any portion or feature of the Service by hacking, password “mining” or other illegitimate method of gaining access to restricted data.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Ringhop reserves the right, in its sole and absolute discretion, to edit or remove any material or information posted by Specialist through the Service, whether or not such material or information violates this Agreement.  Specialist will bear all the risks associated with the uploading and transmitting material utilizing the Service, including reliance on its accuracy, reliability or legality.</p>
        
        <p><u>Indemnification</u></p>
        
        <p>Specialist will indemnify, defend and hold harmless Ringhop, and its employees, representatives, agents and affiliates against any and all losses, damages, suits, judgments, costs and expenses (including litigation costs and reasonable attorneys’ fees) arising out of or in connection with any claim, suit, action, or other proceeding brought against Ringhop or such party, to the extent that such claim, suit, action or other proceeding is based on or arises from (a) any breach of any representation, warranty, covenant or agreement to be performed by Specialist according to this Agreement; (b) Specialist’s provision of services to any third party, regardless of whether or not they are Users of the Service; or (c) any materials or information that Specialist has transmitted through the Service and/or any content on Specialist’s website or otherwise provided to Users.  You represent and warrant that you maintain and will continue to maintain adequate insurance if such insurance is required by any applicable laws or regulations that apply to the provision of services by you, including, without limitation, professional liability insurance applicable to the legal and medical professions.</p>
        
        <p><u>Transactions with Users</u></p>
        
        <p>Ringhop will use reasonable efforts to process a User’s credit card for the amount agreed upon between such User and Specialist within 7 working days from the execution date of each transaction.  As of the Effective Date provided above, Ringhop’s commission structure will be 50% of gross amounts collected for per minute charges to Users.  All payment processing costs (excluding chargebacks, refunds, and associated fees) will be paid by Ringhop from its 50% share of per minute charges.</p>
        
        <p>Notwithstanding the foregoing, Specialist authorizes Ringhop to withhold, in its discretion, payments to Specialist of certain amounts paid by Users by credit card until adequate time has passed to ensure that the payment will not be disputed by the paying User or charged back by such User’s credit card issuer, or, if Ringhop reasonably believes that fraudulent activity may have occurred in connection with payment, until Ringhop is able to verify that no such activity has occurred.</p>
        
        <p>Specialist acknowledges and agrees that Ringhop may, from time to time, advertise and offer promotional pricing for Specialist’s transactions.  Specialist shall honor all promotional pricing applicable to any User transaction.  Ringhop may elect to provide Specialist with the ability to adjust such promotional pricing as desired, or to opt out of offering such promotional pricing.  As a non-limiting example, Ringhop may offer Users 2 minutes of free time for such Users’ first call with a Specialist.  In this example, Ringhop may, but is not obligated to, provide Specialists with the ability to adjust the number of free minutes available to first-time calling Users.  Unless and until Specialists have changed the number of free minutes, Specialists must honor the 2-minutes-free default set by Ringhop.</p>
        
        <p>Ringhop’s billing system is not error-free, and Ringhop shall not be liable for any problems, miscalculations or malfunctions in processing payments due to the Specialist.  If the Specialist believes in good faith that a mistake has occurred he or she must send his/her complaint to Ringhop within 30 days of discovery of such mistake.  If for any reason a User has not paid the amount due to Specialist or has paid but has later charged back such payment, no amount will be paid to the Specialist for that transaction and if the money has already been sent to the Specialist, Specialist is required to repay the amount to Ringhop, and Ringhop has the right to deduct this amount from the Specialist’s account or from the following payments to be made from Ringhop to Specialist.  For Specialists who simultaneously participate as Users, Ringhop shall be entitled to transfer or set-off payments from a Specialist’s pending earnings against such Specialist’s outstanding balance as a User.</p>
        
        <p><u>Your Account Login</u></p>
        
        <p>As part of the registration process, you will be prompted to provide a unique username and password that you must provide in order to gain access to your account with the Service.  You certify that when asked to choose a username you will not choose a name which may falsely represent you as someone else, falsely imply a connection with any profession or organization, or a name which may otherwise be in violation of the rights of a third party.</p>
        
        <p>We reserve the right to disallow the use of usernames that we, in our sole discretion, deem to be inappropriate.  We reserve the right to cancel, at any time, the membership of any Specialist who uses their selected username in violation of this Agreement or in any other way we, in our sole discretion, deem to be inappropriate.</p>
        
        <p>Your account, username, and password are nontransferable and non-assignable.  You represent and warrant that you will not disclose your unique username or password to any other person.  You are solely responsible for maintaining the confidentiality of your username and password and are fully responsible for all activities that occur under your username and password.</p>
        
        <p>You agree to notify Ringhop of any unauthorized use of your username or password and ensure that you logout from your account at the end of each session.  You are liable and responsible for any unauthorized use of the Service until you notify Ringhop regarding that unauthorized use.  Unauthorized access to the Service is illegal and a breach of this Agreement.  You agree to indemnify Ringhop against all activities conducted through your account.</p>
        
        <p><u>Disclaimer of Warranty; Limitation of Liability</u></p>
        
        <p>THE SPECIALIST ACKNOWLEDGES AND AGREES THAT RINGHOP IS BEING PROVIDED FOR USE AS IS, AND THEREFORE SPECIALIST WILL NOT HAVE ANY PLEA, CLAIM OR DEMAND VIS-A-VIS RINGHOP IN RESPECT TO RINGHOP'S USERS, PROPERTIES, LIMITATIONS OR COMPATIBILITY WITH THE SPECIALIST’S NEEDS.  THE USE OF RINGHOP IS ACCORDINGLY BEING MADE AT THE SPECIALIST’S SOLE AND ENTIRE RISK, WITHOUT WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, COMPATIBILITY, SECURITY OR ACCURACY.  RINGHOP EXPRESSLY DISCLAIMS ALL WARRANTIES FOR INFORMATION POSTED OR TRANSMITTED BY ITS USERS.  IF A SPECIALIST DECIDES TO PROVIDE HIS OR HER SERVICES THROUGH THE USE OF THE SERVICE, SUCH SPECIALIST MUST EXERCISE A REASONABLE STANDARD OF CARE, AT LEAST THE SAME AS SPECIALIST WOULD IN A SIMILAR TRANSACTION NOT CONDUCTED THROUGH THE INTERNET, OR THE STANDARD OF CARE MANDATED BY HIS OR HER PROFESSION, WHICHEVER IS HIGHER.  THE SPECIALIST SHALL NOT HAVE ANY PLEA, CLAIM OR DEMAND AGAINST RINGHOP, ITS AFFILIATES, OR THEIR RESPECTIVE OFFICERS, DIRECTORS, SHAREHOLDERS, EMPLOYEES, SUB-CONTRACTORS AND AGENTS IN RESPECT OF ANY SERVICES THAT SPECIALIST DECIDES TO PROVIDE IN CONNECTION WITH THE USE OF THE SERVICE.  RINGHOP WILL NOT BE DEEMED THE PROVIDER OR RECIPIENT OF ANY SERVICES ACQUIRED THROUGH THE SERVICE.  THE SALE OR PURCHASE OF SERVICES IS ACCORDINGLY EFFECTED AT THE SPECIALIST’S SOLE AND ENTIRE RISK.  UNDER NO CIRCUMSTANCES WILL RINGHOP, ITS AFFILIATES, OR THEIR RESPECTIVE OFFICERS, DIRECTORS, SHAREHOLDERS, EMPLOYEES, SUB-CONTRACTORS AND AGENTS BE LIABLE TO ANY SPECIALIST FOR ANY INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, CONSEQUENTIAL, SPECIAL, PUNITIVE OR EXEMPLARY DAMAGES (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF BUSINESS, REVENUE, PROFITS, USE, DATA OR OTHER ECONOMIC ADVANTAGE), HOWEVER IT ARISES, WHETHER IN ACTION OF CONTRACT, NEGLIGENCE OR OTHER TORTIOUS ACTION, OR ARISING FROM THE SERVICES OR ANY PROVISION OF THIS AGREEMENT.  RINGHOP, ITS AFFILIATES, THEIR RESPECTIVE OFFICERS, DIRECTORS, SHAREHOLDERS, EMPLOYEES, SUB-CONTRACTORS AND AGENTS’ AGGREGATE LIABILITY FOR DIRECT DAMAGES ARISING WITH RESPECT TO THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT EXCEED THE TOTAL AMOUNT OF MONEY PAID TO RINGHOP BY SPECIALIST THROUGH THE SERVICE IN THE SIX-MONTH PERIOD PRIOR TO THE DATE THE CLAIM AROSE.  SPECIALIST ACKNOWLEDGES AND AGREES THAT RINGHOP DISCLAIMS ANY LIABILITY WITH RESPECT TO ANY CLAIM, SUIT OR ACTION BROUGHT BY A USER IN CONNECTION WITH PROVISION OF ANY SERVICES BY SPECIALIST (INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, REPRESENTATIONS BY THE SPECIALIST AS TO HIS OR HER QUALIFICATIONS AND ADVICE PROVIDED BY THE SPECIALIST) THROUGH THE SERVICE, AND SPECIALIST AGREES TO INDEMNIFY AND HOLD RINGHOP HARMLESS IN CONNECTION WITH ANY SUCH CLAIM AND ANY DAMAGES OR EXPENSES ARISING THEREFROM. RINGHOP WILL NOT BE LIABLE FOR ENFORCING ANY AGREEMENT THAT WAS MADE BETWEEN A SPECIALIST AND A USER, INCLUDING AGREEMENT REQUIRING PAYMENT.  SPECIALIST WILL BE SOLELY RESPONSIBLE FOR ANY AGREEMENT MADE WITH A USER.  SPECIALIST FURTHER ACKNOWLEDGES THAT SPECIALIST WILL SOLELY BE RESPONSIBLE AND LIABLE FOR ANY DAMAGES TO ANY USER TO WHOM SPECIALIST PROVIDES SERVICES AND WHERE THAT USER SUFFERS DAMAGES ARISING FROM OR CONNECTED TO SUCH SERVICES.  IN THE EVENT OF A DISPUTE REGARDING ANY TRANSACTION CONDUCTED THROUGH THE SERVICE, SPECIALIST HEREBY RELEASES RINGHOP AND ITS AFFILIATES, AND THEIR RESPECTIVE OFFICERS, DIRECTORS, SHAREHOLDERS, EMPLOYEES, SUB-CONTRACTORS AND AGENTS FROM ALL MANNER OF ACTIONS, CLAIMS OR DEMANDS AND FROM ANY AND ALL LOSSES (DIRECT, INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL), DAMAGES, COSTS OR EXPENSES, INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, COURT COSTS AND ATTORNEY’S FEES, WHICH SPECIALIST MAY HAVE AGAINST ONE OR MORE OF THE ABOVE.  IF YOU ARE A PHYSICIAN, MENTAL HEALTH PROFESSIONAL OR OTHER MEDICAL EXPERT: THE ADVICE OR INFORMATION YOU PROVIDE TO USERS IS FOR INFORMATIONAL PURPOSES ONLY AND CANNOT BE CONSIDERED A SUBSTITUTE FOR A FACE-TO-FACE PHYSICAL EXAMINATION OF THE USER BY A MEDICAL PROFESSIONAL.  YOU WILL PROVIDE INFORMATION AND ADVICE ONLY ABOUT NON-EMERGENCY MATTERS.  FOR EMERGENCY MATTERS YOU WILL INSTRUCT THE USER TO IMMEDIATELY CALL 911 OR THEIR LOCAL EMERGENCY ASSISTANCE NUMBER.  IF YOU ARE A PHYSICIAN, MENTAL HEALTH PROFESSIONAL OR OTHER MEDICAL EXPERT, YOU WILL NOT ENGAGE IN THE PRACTICE OF MEDICINE OR ENTER INTO A PHYSICIAN/PATIENT RELATIONSHIP WITH ANY USER THROUGH THE SERVICE.  IN ADDITION, YOU AGREE THAT YOU:</p>
        <ul class="detail-faq">
            <li>Will not diagnose, treat, test, recommend a course of treatment, or otherwise provide or perform services that require an in-person physical examination of a User;</li>
            <li>Will not prescribe or dispense medicines;</li>
            <li>Will recommend that Users seek the advice of a physician who can perform an in-person physical examination; and</li>
            <li>Will advise Users that your advice is not a substitute for the advice of a physician after physical examination and that your advice is for informational purposes only.</li>
        </ul>
        <p><u>Risks Associated with the Service</u></p>
        
        <p>Due to the nature of Internet, computers, data flow, and other technical and economical practicalities, the Service is – as is most computer data and Internet applications – potentially vulnerable to various security issues and hence should be considered unsecured.  By using the Service and the Internet in general, you may be subject to various risks, including among others eavesdropping, sniffing, spoofing, forgery, spamming, “imposturing,” tampering, breaking passwords, harassment, fraud, electronic trespassing, hacking, nuking, system contamination including without limitation, viruses, worms, Trojan horses, causing unauthorized, damaging or harmful access and/or retrieval of information and data on your computer or mobile device.  Information received or delivered on and through the Service may be subject to other security or privacy hazards or may not reach its destination or reach an erroneous address or recipient.  The Service is not different than other Internet applications in this respect.  You hereby release and agree to hold harmless Ringhop and its affiliated companies and the directors, officers, employees, agents, successors, advisors, consultants and assigns of any of the foregoing from any and all causes of action and claims of any nature resulting from any security risk associated with use of the Service.</p>
        
        <p><u>Third-Party Service Required</u></p>
        
        <p>In order to utilize the Service, you must obtain service from one or more service providers who deliver connectivity to the Internet, a telephone network, text or SMS messaging, and/or any other communications network you intend to use with the Service.  Your carrier’s normal rates and fees, such as text messaging and data charges, will apply.  You acknowledge and agree that Ringhop is not responsible for providing access to such communications networks and that Ringhop is not responsible for any increased service fees your carrier may charge you for use of such communications networks in connection with the Service.</p>
        
        <p><u>Representations and Warranties</u></p>
        
        <p>By registering as a Specialist, you, the Specialist, represent, warrant and agree to the following:</p>
        <ul class="detail-faq">
            <li>You are over the age of 18 and legally able to enter into a contract.</li>
            <li>At all times you, the Specialist, will provide correct and accurate representation of skills, degrees, qualifications, background and other information as prompted by any form on the Service, and will maintain and update all such information during the term of this Agreement to keep it true, accurate, current and complete.  You will maintain such skills, qualifications and other information, including maintaining your status in good standing as a licensed professional in any jurisdiction, as may be required by that jurisdiction, where you practice your profession.  You shall not perform services or offer advice in any jurisdiction where you are not authorized or licensed or in good standing to do so.</li>
            <li>You will not provide any legal or medical advice or other advice or information which may only be lawfully rendered or provided by a licensed professional who has established a physician-patient relationship, attorney-client, or other relationship.  You will not provide any medical or legal information unless you are a licensed professional in good standing in the relevant field of expertise and you abide by all relevant laws, rules and regulations, including, without limitation rules of ethics and professional responsibility.</li>
            <li>You will not offer or provide advice, directly or through writings, as to the value of securities or as to the advisability of investing in, purchasing or selling securities or any report or analysis concerning securities.  You will not offer advice or provide any product or services related to or claiming success with lottery numbers.</li>
            <li>You will not misrepresent yourself or create a misleading name or listing. The aforementioned is an ongoing affirmative obligation for the Specialist to maintain and update on a regular basis.</li>
        </ul>
        <p><u>Closing Your Account</u></p>
        
        <p>You may terminate your Agreement with Ringhop at any time by sending a signed notice to Ringhop via mail or fax.  Emails will not be accepted.  Ringhop shall invalidate your username and password within 30 days of receiving such notice.  You may inactivate your account for any desired period of time from within your account dashboard.  Notwithstanding termination, all obligations of a Specialist under this Agreement relating to any activity prior to the termination date shall remain in full force and effect.</p>
        
        <p><u>Termination by Ringhop</u></p>
        
        <p>Without limiting other remedies, Ringhop may immediately issue a warning, temporarily suspend, indefinitely suspend, or terminate your access and use of the Service and refuse to provide our services to you at any time, with or without advance notice, if (a) Ringhop believes that you have breached any term of this Agreement; (b) we are unable to verify or authenticate any information you provide to us; (c) we believe that your actions may cause legal liability for you, our Users or us; or (d) Ringhop decides to cease operations or to otherwise discontinue any of the Service or parts thereof.  Further, you agree that neither Ringhop, nor any third party acting on our behalf, shall be liable to you for any termination of your membership or access to the Service.  You agree that if your account is terminated by Ringhop, you will not attempt to re-register as a User or Specialist without prior written consent from Ringhop.</p>
        
        <p><u>No Assignment</u></p>
        
        <p>You shall not assign this Agreement or assign, pledge or mortgage any rights or delegate any obligations hereunder, in whole or in part, whether voluntarily or by operation of law, without the prior, written consent of Ringhop.  Any purported transfer, assignment or delegation by you without the appropriate prior written approval will be null and void and of no force or effect.</p>
        
        <p><u>No Agency</u></p>
        
        <p>Nothing in this Agreement shall be construed as making either party the partner, joint venture, agent, legal representative, employer or employee of the other.  Neither party shall have, or hold itself out to any third party as having, any authority to make any statements, representations or commitments of any kind, or to take any action that shall be binding on the other, except as provided for herein or authorized in writing by the party to be bound.</p>
        
        <p><u>Entire Agreement</u></p>
        
        <p>This Agreement (and the policies referenced herein and incorporated by reference) constitutes the entire agreement between Ringhop and Specialist with respect to the subject matter hereof, and Specialist has not relied upon any promises or representations by Ringhop with respect to the subject matter except as set forth herein.</p>
        
        <p><u>Arbitration</u></p>
        
        <p>All Disputes (including any dispute relating to the arbitrability of this Agreement or any provision of this Agreement or any other dispute relating to arbitration) must be submitted to arbitration before and in accordance with the commercial arbitration rules of the American Arbitration Association.  The term “Dispute” means any controversy or claim arising out of or relating to the Service or this Agreement, or any breach thereof, including any claim that this Agreement, or any part of this Agreement is invalid, illegal or otherwise voidable or void.</p>
        
        <p>The provisions of this Arbitration Section must be construed as independent of any other covenant or provision of this Agreement; provided that if a court of competent jurisdiction or arbitrator determines that any such provisions are unlawful in any way, such court or arbitrator is to modify or interpret such provisions to the minimum extent necessary to have them comply with the law.  Notwithstanding any provision of this Agreement relating to under which state’s laws this Agreement is to be governed by and construed under, all issues relating to arbitrability or the enforcement of the Agreement to arbitrate contained herein are to be governed by the Federal Arbitration Act (9 U.S.C. § 1 et seq.) and the federal common law of arbitration.</p>
        
        <p>Judgment upon an arbitration award may be entered in any court having competent jurisdiction and will be binding, final and non-appealable.  You and Ringhop hereby waive to the fullest extent permitted by law, any right to or claim for any punitive or exemplary damages against the other and agree that in the event of a dispute between them, each shall be limited to the recovery of any actual damages sustained by it.</p>
        
        <p>This arbitration provision is self-executing and will remain in full force and effect after the expiration or termination of this Agreement.  In the event either party fails to appear at any properly noticed arbitration proceeding, an award may be entered against such party by default or otherwise notwithstanding said failure to appear.</p>
        
        <p>Arbitration takes place in Miami-Dade County, Florida, exclusively.</p>
        
        <p>You and Ringhop hereby agree that no action (whether for arbitration, damages, injunctive, equitable or other relief, including rescission) will be maintained by any party to enforce any liability or obligation of the other party, whether arising from this Agreement or otherwise, or any other Dispute, unless brought before the expiration of the earlier of one year from the occurrence of the facts giving rise to such claims or within 90 days from either the actual discovery of the facts giving rise to such claims or from the date on which the party should have, in the exercise of reasonable diligence, discovered such facts.</p>
        
        <p>The obligation to arbitrate is not binding upon Ringhop with respect to claims relating to its trademarks, service marks, patents, copyrights, or other intellectual property rights, or requests for temporary restraining orders, preliminary injunctions or other procedures in a court of competent jurisdiction to obtain interim relief when deemed necessary by such court to preserve the status quo or prevent irreparable injury pending resolution by arbitration of the actual dispute between the parties.</p>
        
        <p>The prevailing party will be entitled to receive from the non-prevailing party its costs relating to the arbitration proceeding including but not limited to, the arbitrator’s fees, attorneys’ fees and costs, witness fees, transcription fees, etc. and sales and use taxes thereon, if any.</p>
        
        <p>You and Ringhop each acknowledges and agrees that it is the intent of the parties that arbitration and litigation between the parties will be of the parties’ individual claims, and that none of their respective claims may be arbitrated or litigated on a class-wide basis.</p>
