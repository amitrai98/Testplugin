                Ringhop Service Terms of Use
                Effective:  October 30, 2014
                PLEASE READ THIS TERMS OF USE AGREEMENT CAREFULLY.  BY VISITING OUR WEBSITE AND/OR USING OUR SERVICE IN ANY WAY, YOU DEMONSTRATE YOUR AGREEMENT TO BE BOUND BY THESE TERMS, INCLUDING ANY AND ALL TERMS INCORPORATED BY REFERENCE.  IF YOU DO NOT AGREE TO ALL OF THESE TERMS, YOU MAY NOT ACCESS OR USE OUR WEBSITE OR SERVICE.
                This Terms of Use Agreement (this “Agreement”) is a legal agreement that governs our relationship with users who visit our website, Ringhop.com (the “Website”), or who register for a user account for our live interaction platform (the “Service”).  The Service is owned and operated by Lakewood Group, LLC (“we,” “us,” “our,” or “Ringhop”).  This Agreement sets forth and contains all of the terms relating to use of the Service by you and Ringhop.
                Right to Use
                Your right to use the Service is subject to any limitations, conditions, and restrictions established and enforced by us from time to time, in our sole discretion.  We may alter, suspend, or discontinue any aspect of the Service at any time, including the availability of any Service feature, database, or content.  We may also impose limits on certain features and aspects of the Service or restrict your access to parts or all of the Service without notice or liability.
                Our Platform
                Ringhop provides a platform where information providers and entertainers (each a “Specialist”) may present his or her expertise, charge for his or her time, and/or sell advice or services to you and other interested Ringhop users (“Users”).  Ringhop makes no representation or warranty whatsoever as to the quality, completeness, or accuracy of any information or advice provided by a Specialist through the Service.
                You acknowledge and agree that Specialists are neither employees nor agents nor representatives of Ringhop, and Ringhop assumes no responsibility for any act or omission of any Specialist.
                As further described in this Agreement, we make no representation or warranty whatsoever as to (i) the accuracy or availability of the Service; (ii) the willingness or ability of any Specialist to give advice; (iii) whether you will find an Specialist’s advice relevant, useful, accurate or satisfactory; (iv) whether the advice of any Specialist will be responsive or relevant to your question; or (v) whether any Specialist’s advice will otherwise be suitable to your needs.  We do not verify the skills, degrees, qualifications, credentials or background of any Specialist.  It is strongly recommended that you independently verify the skills, degrees, qualifications, credentials and background of each Specialist from whom you receive or contemplate to receive advice or services.
                The Service may contain financial information provided by third parties.  Such content is provided for informational purposes only and is not intended, and should not be used, for trade or investment purposes.  Furthermore, the Service may include bulletin boards which allow you to post questions to Specialists regarding various topics and allow Specialists to volunteer answers to such questions.  AS NOTED IN THIS AGREEMENT, RINGHOP DOES NOT WARRANT THE VALIDITY, ACCURACY, OR AVAILABILITY OF ANY CONTENT OR ADVICE PROVIDED, AND RINGHOP WILL NOT BE LIABLE FOR ANY DAMAGES SUSTAINED BY YOU DUE TO RELIANCE ON ANY SUCH INFORMATION OR ADVICE.
                Information furnished by Specialists is intended for general information purposes or entertainment purposes only.  Any consultation with a Specialist via the Service cannot and does not replace a meeting with a professional.  You are encouraged to verify the information furnished by Specialists.  Any reliance on such information is done at your full and sole risk and liability.
                Specialists in Fields Requiring Licensure and/or Certification
                If you choose to interact on or through the Service with any medical professional, mental health professional, physician, attorney or other Specialist in a field requiring licensure and/or certification, your relationship (as with all other Specialists) is strictly with the Specialist.  Ringhop is not involved in any way with the substance of that relationship or the advice or information given therein, and Ringhop does not validate the information or advice provided to you by such Specialist.
                The advice or information provided by medical professionals, mental health professionals and physicians is provided for informational purposes only and cannot be considered a substitute for a face-to-face physical examination of your person by a doctor or other health professional.  You should not rely on or make health decisions based on advice provided by any Specialist on the Service.  Ringhop strongly recommends that, if you are seeking medical or mental health advice, you should make an appointment for an examination in person with a qualified professional.
                The advice or information provided by attorneys and other Specialists in fields requiring licensure and/or certification is provided for informational purposes only and cannot be considered a substitute for an in-person meeting.
                We do not review, endorse, recommend, verify or evaluate, or otherwise provide any warranty or guarantee with respect to, any mental health professional, medical professional, physician, attorney or other professional or Specialist on the site.  You understands that it is your responsibility to check the certification and/or licensing of the medical professional, mental health professional, physician, attorney or other professional Specialist with the applicable state licensing board or authorities in the Specialist’s state or country.
                You understand and agree that, although a mental or medical health professional, physician, attorney or other professional Specialist may have been accessed through the Service, Ringhop cannot predict or assess the competence, or appropriateness for your needs, of the professional or other Specialist.  You also acknowledge and agree that you take full responsibility for the decision to access a medical professional, mental health professional, physician, attorney or other Specialist through the Service and to continue to interact with the medical professional, mental health professional, physician, attorney or other Specialist, and that the role of Ringhop is strictly limited to providing access to such professionals and other Specialists for your consideration.
                You hereby release and agree to hold harmless Ringhop and its affiliated companies and the directors, officers, employees, agents, successors, advisors, consultants and assigns of any of the foregoing from any and all causes of action and claims of any nature resulting from any act, omission, opinion, response, advice, suggestion, information and/or service of any medical professional, mental health professional, physician or attorney, or any other Specialist in a field requiring licensure and/or certification, who may be accessed through the Service.
                IF YOU ARE THINKING ABOUT SUICIDE, IF YOU FEEL THAT YOU MAY BE A DANGER TO YOURSELF OR TO OTHERS OR IF YOU OTHERWISE HAVE ANY MEDICAL EMERGENCY, PLEASE IMMEDIATELY NOTIFY THE POLICE OR EMERGENCY MEDICAL SERVICES IN YOUR AREA. IN THE UNITED STATES, PLEASE DIAL 911.

                You must be 18 years old to register as a User and utilize the Service to interact with Specialists and other Users.  Ringhop shall have the right, but not the obligation, to request that you provide copies of a valid, government-issued, photo ID to establish your compliance with this age requirement.
